# Report 1 (Week 2 of 08.31.2023) 


## Refelections

- This week, I learned how to operate Rhino and Grasshopper on a beginner level.
  
- Explored what Rhino and Grasshopper can be used for such as architecture and computational design.
  
- How to utilize a laser cut machine on my own for the first time.
  
- Learned that the thickness, and material types of the wood board I’m cutting were also important.
  
- Combined everything from Rhino, Grasshopper, Illustrator to Laser Cutting enabled to see how design is seen from a macro level where everything is connected.

## Speculations
- I recently learned about computational design and the tools for it are Rhino and Grasshopper. I think with AI emerging, it might be able to make the process of computing data into products that will be more user-friendly. The designs that were generated from Rhino and Grasshopper so far from our project seem to me that the designs it generated had a lot of limits to the users.

- I think it would also be cool if we could do all of this in VR instead of having multiple desktops and windows opened. Modeling in VR is becoming a common thing so maybe when we’re traveling and still want to work in Rhino and Grasshopper, all we need is the VR device.

I read that:
>*“Grasshopper helps define the relationship between the model and its components, making it easy to manipulate and generate explorative forms that have a multi-dimensional functionality”*

And the plugin [grasshopper] and its intuitive way...
> *”...can develop a design is helping many designers to experiment with thought-provoking geometries which earlier weren’t possible”.*

I could see how this will be or already is being used to create architectures, products, and designs that are sustainability-focused. With the climate becoming extreme, there are already research and ongoing projects that utilize all of the software I used this week to [conceptual structural design for assessing the embodied environmental impact](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11990).
