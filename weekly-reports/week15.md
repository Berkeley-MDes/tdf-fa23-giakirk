## Final Project Feedback

• Feedback on expressing joy instead of suffering: I received some feedback about the lamp that instead of expressing suffering, what if it expresses joy instead whenever the user is conscious of their energy consumption. 
• Aesthetics and concept refinement: And another critic says that the lamp is a very aesthetic piece to have around the house, but the concept of anthropomorphize suffering in the product needs refinement. Which I found these suggestions useful

# Speculations and Conclusion:
• Through the technologies I explored, I speculate a need for the adoption of suffering-centered framework combined with anthropomorphizing products. Consumer behavior will continue to be largely influenced by emotional marketing and branding. But what if there’s a possibility to prolong a product’s life cycle if we can feel and empathize with the suffering around us more?
