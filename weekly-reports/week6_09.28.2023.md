# Report 6 (Week 7 of 09/21 - 9/28)

## ðŸ’­ Topic

- I want to do the MDES Design Challenge. The prompt for this year is designing a lamp and the theme is Reclamation.

- The brief: in this semester's first MDes design challenge, we will be designing lamps! The twist for this challenge is that designs must include some element of reclaimed material. This is a great opportunity to let your imagination go wild! Final designs will be showcased to a guest judge on Friday, October 20th at 2:15 PM.Â 


## ðŸ”Ž Setting a Board Objective:
- I first began looking into reclamation and what that means to me. Reclamation to me is rightfully bringing back the value of a person's object or idea.

I did an undergrad project on homelessness called Belonging Again. It is an art program that aids those experiencing homelessness mentally and therapeutically through the process of upcycling and repurposing found objects into new art.

I was trying to see if I could expand from this project but I thought maybe this is a chance to explore something completely new. I set my objective to be stepping out of my comfort zone and have fun with it even if it might not be realistic!


## Observation and Questioning:
- Thinking of light, I thought of light pollution. I wonder if we can reclaim natural light and the comfort of being in the dark.

So I started asking more questions:
- I wonder if thereâ€™s a way to utilize UV light.
- Can this prompt be about reclaiming an idea as well? Reclaim who we are as the human-like our ancestors who were adapted to nature and darkness comfortably? 
- Can light be textiles? Textile light that weâ€™ve seen!
- Stupid thought butâ€¦Maxwell Dillon, the villain from Marvel Comics, what if we can gain power to generate and control electricity? So bioelectronics?
- What if we could have a wearable device that transfers light from one place to another place?
- What was life like before the light bulb?
- What if using bioelectronics, we create glasses or eye contacts that strike more light into our retina to see better in the dark?


## Observation and research-ish:
1. Textiles that fight pollution: 
    - https://news.cnrs.fr/videos/textiles-that-fight-pollution
    - It uses photocatalysis. Destroy pollutants in the presence of light. And is found in self-cleaning concrete and paint
      
2. https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnt/2015/104142/
    - This paper focuses on decontaminating pollution using photocatalysts in textiles. This process of photocatalytic oxidation decomposes deadly chemical contamination and makes better indoor air quality. Photocatalytic oxidation is achieved through a semiconductor oxide which is shown to be suitable for the degradation of organic compounds and inorganic oxides. There are 2 ways for photocatalytic oxidation: 1) by imparting nanoparticles of semiconductor oxides into a spinning solution while spinning nanofibers or 2) by coating nanoparticles of semiconductor oxides onto the textile substrate.

 3. LED bulbs are the most environmentally friendly bulbs right now. Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) are also eco-friendly, though not as much as LED bulbs. They are far less energy efficient than LED bulbs

4.  https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/everyday-wonders/electric-lighting-home
    - Carbonized bamboo was used to help Edison make the light public. Carbonized bamboo was made into thin filaments. A fine strip is used, bent to their desired hairpin or looped shapes to fit into the light bulb
    - HPS bulbs emit both UV and infrared rays, meaning that they can cause major damage to your eyes if you don't take steps to protect yourself.
