# Report 6 (Week 7 of 09/21 - 9/28)

## üí≠ Topic

- I am taking Locative Media and in this class, we examine maps and other locative media.
- I was trying to understand what would be a locative media for an assignment that I was working on so I did some research and readings.


## Chosen Locatie Media:
- The locative media I chose to examine is the "San Francisco Poop Map".
- The SF poop map was created by a software engineer, Jennifer Wong. This visualization of human waste featured the notorious ‚Äúpoop‚Äù emoji which is used to identify the locations of human waste throughout the city of San Francisco.
