## ðŸ’­ Topic

- Anthropomorphize.
- I continued looking into the topic of anthropomorphizing. I am wondering if this technique can enhance our relationship with technology as well. I think building an empathetic, conscious, and meaningful relationship with our technological tools would be helpful rather than treating them as merely objects.


## Observation and Questioning:
	
 - I did some readings on cybernetics by Kelly Dobson and Donna Herraway and was fascinated by the concept of cybernetics and connecting this to anthropomorphism. 
	
 - Anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to non-human entities, including objects and technology, has been a recurring phenomenon throughout history. Even before the term "cybernetics" emerged, humans had anthropomorphized things, imbuing them with human-like qualities. This tendency takes on new significance in the context of cybernetics as it aligns with the idea that humans are integrated into larger systems and processes.
	
 - Even in pre-cybernetic eras, humans anthropomorphized objects and phenomena. Ancient cultures attributed human-like qualities to natural elements and animals and created deities with human characteristics. This historical anthropomorphism suggests a long-standing inclination to understand and relate to the world in human terms.
	
 - The analysis of cybernetics in the provided text aligns with the idea that humans are cybernetic beings integrated into larger systems. As highlighted in the text, the mutual influence between culture and computation reflects the ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics between humans and technology.
	Acknowledging that anthropomorphism and integration into larger systems have been inherent aspects of human existence raises philosophical questions about human agency and free will. The traditional notion of the liberal humanist subject, as discussed in the text, emphasizes individual autonomy and freedom from external influence.
 	
 - The philosophical concept of determinism emerges when considering the inherent integration of humans into larger systems. If we have always been cybernetic beings, continuously anthropomorphizing and entwined in technological and cultural systems, it challenges the idea of an autonomous and self-sufficient "self." This leads to the question: Have humans ever had true free will, or have we always been subject to external influences and systemic determinants?
The interconnected themes of anthropomorphism, cybernetics, and the historical context explored in the text suggest that the traditional understanding of human agency and autonomy is nuanced. Acknowledging our continuous integration into larger systems prompts philosophical reflections on the nature of free will and challenges the myth of the independent, possessive self. The symbiotic relationship between humans and technology, evident in both historical anthropomorphism and the cybernetic era, raises profound questions about the nature of human existence and agency.
