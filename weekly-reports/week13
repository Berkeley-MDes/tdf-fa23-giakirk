- Final Project Brainstorm: 
	###SUMMARY: A brief description of your project idea and goal. Include the project domain, technology application, and scenario.
		- Suffering is the result of desire especially at this current time that we live in. As consumers, we might not suffer from the consequences of our decisions but those that are at disadvantaged than us are burdened by our consumption habits. 
		- Suffering is ubiquitous. We canâ€™t escape it. Acknowledging suffering allows us not only to understand ourselves but to understand others as well. Empathy is gained from this experience which gives hope to a movement of ethical and conscious consumers. But how should we empathize with other's suffering without causing more suffering when there's already too many.
		- The answer is in the choice of the designers not consumers. Therefore, as a designer that is passionate about suffering, I reclaim suffering in design through suffering-centered design. The final product will be a lamp that is anthropomorphized--specifically it will display suffering when it's overused. The lamp design will be installed at home to observe if my roommates will be more conscious of their light consumption or not. The project's success is measured by my roommates' habit of turning the lights off when it's not used and the change in our electricity bill.
	
	###RESEARCH PLAN: The series of exploratory technology experiments necessary to get to your desired goal.
		- The technology I will be exploring is the motor servo, light sensor, soldering materials and some coding.
	
	###CURRENT WORK: The results of your preliminary technology experiments and next steps.
		- Currently have a wire-protype of the lamp's shape. I will attempt to solder this week.
	
	###MOTIVATION: 
		- Explore if anthropomorphizing products and design could impact consumer behaviors, change the way we consume (in this case is the way we consume electricity and light).
