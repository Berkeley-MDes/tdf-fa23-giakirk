## ðŸ’­ Reflections

- This week, was chill after completing Project 1 so I started cooking a lot this week. 

## ðŸ”Ž Bad Chef Gia
- I could not cook before to save my life so I was eating tuna cans and rice every single day during my first week in Berkeley.
- Just for reference this was during the first week before I learned how to cook:

## Gia Chef On The Move
- My roommates saw the horrific things I did in the kitchen so they showed me a few techniques in the kitchen.
- I learned how to:

  2. Cook chicken
  3. Fry eggs
  4. Season my food
