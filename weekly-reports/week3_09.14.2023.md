Computational Design: Learning Grasshopper in 5 Days and I Got a Phone Case??!!

Goals:
- Personalization: Modify the baseline grasshopper+rhino file to include my own geometric design.
- Must demonstrate an understanding of how to rewire the grasshopper [file] to meet these requirements. 
- Consider the various grasshopper operations involved in a procedural, generative model (boolean operations, subtractions, offsets, etc). The result will be a custom design system.
- The result is something relevant to my life.



Ideate/sketching:
		○ My need was to create a multifunctional phone stand--would either be versatile enough for various devices to fit or can hold multiple devices at once.
		○ I started doing some sketches for my needs to create a personalized stand that can hold a phone and an iPad. Here are some of the sketches: 
	
	

Exploring the tools
	- Since I wasn't at all familiar with Rhino or Grasshopper five days ago yet. I asked for advice on how to get started and received this feedback:
	1. Replicate rhino 3D geometry with some parametric
	2. Import 3d model directly into Grasshopper
	3. Go into the simplified phone stand and try to replace the geometry

I began doing some exercises to familiarize myself with the Rhino interface, modeling tools, and generative features of Grasshopper.


1. Replicate rhino 3D geometry with some parametric:
- I began this by watching a YouTube tutorial on how to model a water bottle in Rhino. 
	• Insert picture
- After the water model, I then modeled one of the phone stands from my ideation sketch.
	• Insert picture
- The water bottle took me 30 minutes but the phone stand took me about 2-3 hours.


2. Import 3d model directly into Grasshopper
- After I did some modeling exercises, I learned that I could combine my model in Rhino with Grasshopper and then generate something (which I didn't know prior to that)
	• Here's a picture of me realizing how to import the Rhino model into Grasshopper using 
		○ Insert a picture of how I imported it


3. Go into the simplified phone stand and try to replace the geometry:
- So now that I have done the two things above. I still had trouble combining both the Rhino model AND Grasshopper.
- As a result, I went back to watch TJ's video and manipulate the geometry in the given file:
	• On the left is a picture of the before I replace the geometry and on the right is a picture of after I replace the sphere with a cube (The cube picture doesn't look anything like a phone stand but the idea was to understand this system that was created in grasshopper).
		○ Insert picture 


Putting it all together!

Ok so now that I did all of the above…I was still confused LOL. But I started modeling from Grasshopper this time instead of modeling in Rhino first. And what I ended up getting in Grasshopper is shown below:
- Insert picture
- Of course, there were a lot of iterations and changes to get here but I won't show you all that mess. But the 3 things I want to show in this model are its ability to hold a phone or an iPad. There's a cross on the phone holder (which you can see in the end result pic). The gap in the x-direction is smaller than the gap in the z-direction. This will allow the phone to either stand vertically when placed in the x-direction gap or slant upward when the phone is placed in the z-direction.

THE RESULT:
- Here's the final product
