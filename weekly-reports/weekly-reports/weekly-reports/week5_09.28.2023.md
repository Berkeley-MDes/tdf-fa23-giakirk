## ðŸ’­ Background Info

- This week, I learned how product design works. I did a lot of User Research for a different class called Studio Foundations. We had to do a lot of sketches
- We were given a prompt and it was to create an elixir that focuses on zero waste. We got to the stage where we had completed the UX research and prototyping. All we had left to do was to create 2 illustration boards.
